# Momo Themes

These themes are the ones I've modified throughout the past few years when using Sublime Text.
They're a combination of Material theme, Boxy theme, Solarized theme, and some of my preferences.
With the lack of light themes, I would say mine is pretty decent and very easy on the eyes.
Do keep in mind that these are not final and I'll keep updating them. If you don't like any of the new changes, you can install a specific version from VS Code or just fork it.

Themes in this package:
- Momo Light
- Momo Dark
- Momo Sol Light
- Momo Sol Dark
- Momo One Dark
- Momo Sol Purple (testing)

## Styling Guides
These are the main principles I am using when creating the color themes. I try to keep things simple. Everything else is either just the base foreground or from the base palette to keep them look easy to the eyes.
- 5 ui layers
  - outermost: title bar, status bar
  - outer: activity bar, sidebar section header
  - middle: sidebar, widget, popups
  - inner: gutter, inactive tabs
  - base
- punctuations and comments should be lighter than foreground, more like middle of background and foreground
- main color scheme tokens
  - class, function, keyword, strings, constants, operators
  - markup tags are treated as functions, attributes as comments
  - json keys have two alternating colors
