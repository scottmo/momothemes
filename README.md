# Momo Themes

These themes are the ones I've modified throughout the past few years when using Sublime Text.
They're a combination of Material theme, Boxy theme, Solarized theme, and some of my preferences.
With the lack of light themes, I would say mine is pretty decent and very easy on the eyes.

Themes in this package:
- Momo Light
- Momo Dark
- Momo Sol Light
- Momo Sol Dark
- Momo One Dark
- Momo Sol Purple (testing)

## Styling Guides
These are the main principles I am using when creating the color themes. I try to keep things simple. Everything else is either just the base foreground or from the base palette to keep them look easy to the eyes.
- 5 ui layers
  - outermost: title bar, status bar
  - outer: activity bar, sidebar section header
  - middle: sidebar, widget, popups
  - inner: gutter, inactive tabs
  - base
- punctuations and comments should be lighter than foreground, more like middle of background and foreground
- main color scheme tokens
  - class, function, keyword, strings, constants, operators
  - markup tags are treated as functions, attributes as comments
  - json keys have two alternating colors
