# Momo Themes

These themes are the ones I've modified throughout the past few years when using Sublime Text.
They're a combination of Material theme, Boxy theme, Solarized theme, and some of my preferences.
With the lack of light themes, I would say mine is pretty decent and very easy on the eyes.

Themes in this package:
- Momo Light
- Momo Dark
- Momo Sol Light
- Momo Sol Dark
- Momo One Dark
- Momo Sol Purple (testing)
